# Language translation with transformers
This the main repo for all natural language processing related projects

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be writing same code over and over again
* You should reuse code as much as possible

## Prerequisites
